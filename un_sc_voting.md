## How to overcome the "veto power" in the UN Security Council 

What happens if during the voting in the UN Security Council, representatives of one of the permanent members of the Security Council are absent or shall abstain from voting? 

[Art. 27 (3) UN Charter](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-5) states: 
> Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VI, and under paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting. 

From January until August 1950 the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN Security Council in protest that the Republic of China and not the People's Republic of China held a permanent seat on the Council.

During this period, decisions of SC were made without the voice of the Soviet Union and they are accepted as legitimate, including by the Soviet Union itself. 

Most important, this includes [UN SC Resolution #84 (1950) of 7 July 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_84): 

Having determined that the invasion of South Korea by forces from North Korea constituted a breach of the peace, the Council recommended that the members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the South Korean state as may be necessary to repel the attack and restore peace and security to the area. The Council further recommended that all members providing military forces and other assistance to The Republic make these forces and assistance available to a unified command under the United States of America.

In [1950](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/ctc/uncharter.pdf) art. 27 (3) had instead the word "nine" the word "seven", but all other words were the same. 

That should mean, that words **"including the concurring votes of the permanent members"** mean, that *if there were no vote from one permanent member, but votes of all other permanent members are concurring, the decision is considered accepted and valid*. Right? 

That means that even if a permanent member of SC under paragraph 3 of Article 27 as party to a dispute shall abstain from voting or he does not have authorized representatives, the decision of SC may be adopted and valid without the vote of that permanent member.

That is, if Ukraine makes an official appeal to the Security Council in accordance with art. 35 of the UN Charter, then in accordance with art. 27 (3) of the Charter, the Russian Federation must abstain from voting, and the decision will be made without taking into account its vote. And the resolution of the Security Council is binding on all members of the UN according to art. 25 of the Charter.
