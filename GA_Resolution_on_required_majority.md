# On voting on the termination of the existence of the Soviet Union and its representation in the UN.

*The General Assembly*,

*Noting* that the General Assembly will have to consider the fact that, as a result of the signing of the Belovezhskaya Accords, the Soviet Union ceased to exist as an international legal personality law and, consequently, as a member of the UN, and to prevent disagreement over the voting procedure on such an issue,

*Noting* that the issues of the termination of the existence of UN member states and the representation of states in the UN were decided by a simple majority of votes in the General Assembly, in particular when adopting General Assembly Resolutions [2758 (XXVI) of 25.10.1971](https://github.com/ageyev/un-su/blob/main/documents/un/1971-10-25_UN_GA_Resolution_2758_en.png) and [47/1 of 22.09.1992](https://github.com/ageyev/un-su/blob/main/documents/un/1992-09-22_UN_GA_Resolution_47-1_1992_en.png) 

Decides, that the question of the termination of the existence of the Soviet Union and its representation in the UN can be decided by the General Assembly by a simple majority of votes, in accordance with Part Art. 18 (3) of the UN Charter.
