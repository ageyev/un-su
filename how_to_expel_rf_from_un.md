On the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 77) representatives of some states, including the United States and Ukraine, expressed the view that the Russian Federation, using the right of veto in the UN Security Council, commits crimes against peace and international security with impunity, and therefore some action must be taken to prevent the abuse of the right of veto, or even to remove the Russian Federation from the UN. However, no practical scenarios have been proposed to implement this.

This is indeed a very complex legal problem. We will propose legally possible scenarios for overcoming the right of veto and even removing the Russian Federation from its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.
