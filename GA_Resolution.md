# Restoration of the UN Charter rules and principles of the international law concerning the succession and continuation of states.

*The General Assembly*,

*Recalling* the UN Charter rules and principles of the international law concerning the succession and continuation of states, which, in particular, were expressed in General Assembly Resolution [2758 (XXVI) of 25.10.1971](https://github.com/ageyev/un-su/blob/main/documents/un/1971-10-25_UN_GA_Resolution_2758_en.png), Security Counsil Resolution [777 (1992) of 19.09.1992](https://github.com/ageyev/un-su/blob/main/documents/un/1992-09-19_UN_SC_Resolution_777_1992_en.png)  and General Assemly Resolution [47/1 of 22.09.1992](https://github.com/ageyev/un-su/blob/main/documents/un/1992-09-22_UN_GA_Resolution_47-1_1992_en.png)

*Considering* the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as an international legal personality and a subject of international law no longer exists, as it was clearly and unambiguously stated in Belovezh Accords 1991, ratified by states successors of the USSR, including Russian Federation, and also declared in the Alma-Ata Protocols 1991, and confirmed by the Declaration no. 142-N of the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR,

*Recognizing* that there is no and can be no state continuator to the USSR, 

*Recognizing* that since the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has ceased to exist, only four permanent members remain in the UN Security Council, 

*Decides* to expel forthwith the representatives of the Russian Federation from the place of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it, including United Nations Security Council.

*Decides* that this Resolution shall not have retroactive effect, and shall not in itself entail the annulment or revision of Security Council Resolutions adopted to date.

*Proclaims* the desire to see Russia as a future member of the UN, provided that in the future it fulfills the conditions for membership provided for by the UN Charter, including the requirement to be a peace-loving state.
