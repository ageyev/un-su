# Description of the problem. 

Art. [23 (1)](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-5) of the UN Charter states: 

> The Republic of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America shall be permanent members of the Security Council. 

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics no longer exists, but its seat at the UN, including the seat of permanent member of the Security Council, is currently occupied by the representatives of the Russian Federation. 

They claim that RF is the continuator to the USSR, in other words that RF is the same international legal personality as the USSR (like, for example, Ukraine is the same state as Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), and thus the words "the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" in UN Chapter indicate the very state that is now called the Russian Federation.

But, as we explain further, the truth is that:

1) USSR as an international legal personality, and as a member of UN no longer exists
2) RF is not the same international legal personality as USSR, but a different one, in other worlds RF is a *successor*, but not *continuator* to the USSR. 
3) Consequently, the performance by RF's representatives of the role of the Soviet Union in the UN is a violation of international law. 

Acting in clear contradiction to the principles set forth in the UN Charter, and against the very purpose of the existence of the United Nations, Russian Federation started on February 24, 2002 the biggest war in Europe since the end of II World War (see [United Nations General Assembly resolution ES-11/1 of 2 March 2022 ](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution_ES-11/1)). 

On February 27, 2002 Russian President gave the order to bring the nuclear forces of the Russian Federation to the "highest degree of combat readiness", justifying this with unfriendly statements by the leaders of other countries about the war unleashed by him (see [official information from Kremlin](http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67876)) Never before in history has a head of a nuclear-weapon state threatened to use nuclear weapons for hurtful remarks by leaders of other countries. 

If earlier it was possible not to notice the illegality of the participation of representatives of the Russian Federation in the work of the Security Council, then in the current dangerous situation it is clearly preventing the Security Council from exercising its functions of protecting peace, for which the United Nations was actually created. 

# The history 

## Belovezh Accords 

### Text 

[The Belovezh Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belovezh_Accords) were signed on 8 December 1991 by leaders of three of the four republics which had signed the 1922 [Treaty on the Creation of the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Creation_of_the_Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics)

The original [text](https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BE_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2) was in Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian. 

There is no official translation to English. 

The preamble of the document stated that: 

 > Союз ССР, как субъект международного права и геополитическая реальность, прекращает свое существование 

 This can be translated in English as:

 > "the USSR, as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence"

 as translated on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belovezh_Accords#Legal_basis_and_ratification),
 or as was translated by The European Commission for Democracy through Law, also known as [the Venice Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Commission): 

 > the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality no longer exists.

See: [European Commission for Democracy through Law: Agreements establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/alma-alta-commonwealth-of-independent-states-december-1991.pdf) 

### Ratification 

On 12 December 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR formally ratified the Belovezh Accords. See [Постановление Верховного Совета РСФСР от 12 декабря 1991 года № 2014-I «О ратификации Соглашения о создании Содружества Независимых Государств»](http://base.garant.ru/10164306/) 

According to [art. 15 (4)](http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-02.htm) of Constitution of the Russian Federation "international treaties and agreements of the Russian Federation shall be a component part of its legal system. If an international treaty or agreement of the Russian Federation fixes other rules than those envisaged by law, the rules of the international agreement shall be applied" ("международные договоры Российской Федерации являются составной частью ее правовой системы. Если международным договором Российской Федерации установлены иные правила, чем предусмотренные законом, то применяются правила международного договора") 

On December 10 1991 the agreement was ratified by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the Supreme Council of Belarus.

## Treaty "On succession in relation to external state debt and assets of the USSR"  

Before ratification of the Belovezh Accords, on December 4, 1991  was also signed an agreement "On succession in relation to external state debt and assets of the USSR" (["О правопреемстве в отношении внешнего государственного долга и активов Союза ССР"](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/901777444)) which was signed by states - former members of USSR, including RSFSR, and *by the USSR itself.

*This clearly shows that RSFSR and USSR are not the same international legal personality, but two different personalities, which even had entered into agreements with each other.*

## The Alma-Ata Protocols 

[The Alma-Ata Protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma-Ata_Protocol) were signed on 21 December 1991 by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. 

The protocols consisted of a declaration, three agreements and separate appendices (see [Перечень документов, принятых на заседании Совета глав государств СНГ 21 декабря 1991 года, Алма-ата](https://e-cis.info/page/3471/80705/))

In [Alma-Ata declaration](https://web.archive.org/web/20010122033300/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/belarus/by_appnc.html) was repeated the statement from the Belovezh Accord that USSR ceases to exist:

> With the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States the USSR ceases to exist. 

In Russian: "С образованием Содружества Независимых Государств Союз Советских Социалистических Республик прекращает свое существование" (see: http://cis.minsk.by/reestr/ru/index.html#reestr/view/text?doc=4) 

It was also signed [Decision of the Council of Heads of States of the Commonwealth
Independent States](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1900103), art. 1 of wich stated: 

> The Commonwealth states support Russia in continuing the membership of the USSR in the UN, including permanent membership in the Security Council, and other international organizations

In Russian: "Государства Содружества поддерживают Россию в том, чтобы она продолжила членство СССР в ООН, включая постоянное членство в Совете Безопасности, и других международных организациях"

Nor Declaration, not Decision of the Council of Heads of States did not expect ratification, and were not ratified. 

Here we should note wording was 'continuing the membership', not 'continuing the international legal personality'

We must also be aware that the support of the Russian Federation in the aspiration to become a member of the UN could be considered as political support for this aspiration, but not as a decision granting the Russian Federation membership in the UN or, even more so, a seat on the Security Council, since the Council of Heads of States of the CIS could in no way replace the General Assembly of the United Nations and take decisions within the competence of the General Assembly.

## Declaration no. 142-N of the Soviet of the Republics of the USSR

The Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on its [last](https://history.wikireading.ru/333679) session on December 26, 1991 adopted [Declaration no. 142-N](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_no._142-N_of_the_Soviet_of_the_Republics_of_the_Supreme_Soviet_of_the_USSR):

> The Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, following the will of the supreme state organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan, of the Republic of Armenia, of the Republic of Belarus, of the Republic of Kazakhstan, of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, of the Republic of Moldova, of the Russian Federation, of the Republic of Tajikistan, of Turkmenistan, of the Republic of Uzbekistan and of Ukraine regarding the creation of the Commonwealth of the Independent States, stipulates that with the creation of Commonwealth of the Independent States, the Union of SSR[1] ceases to exist as a state and as a subject of international law. 

See in Russian [Декларация c cвязи c cозданием Содружества Независимых Государств, 26 Декабря 1991 № 142-Н](https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA_%D0%92%D0%A1_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_26.12.1991_%E2%84%96_142-%D0%9D)

## RF's membership in the UN and UN Security Council. 

On December 24, 1991 (Christmas Eve) the Secretary-General of the United Nations Pérez de Cuéllar informed the member states that he had received a letter from the Permanent Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics transmitting a [letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20031123143520/http:/www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/inf397.shtml#att2) from the President of the Russian Federation (RSFSR) B. Yeltsin:  

> Sir,
> I have the honour to inform you that the membership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the United Nations, including the Security Council and all other organs and organizations of the United Nations system, is being continued by the Russian Federation (RSFSR) with the support of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In this connection, I request that the name "the Russian Federation" should be used in the United Nations in place of the name "the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics".
> The Russian Federation maintains full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Charter of the United Nations, including the financial obligations.
> I request you to consider this letter as confirmation of the credentials to represent the Russian Federation in the United Nations organs for all the persons currently holding the credentials of representatives of the USSR to the United Nations.
> Accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.

As described by Larry D. Johnson, then Principal Legal Officer in the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs in his article [United Nations Response Options to Russia’s Aggression: Opportunities and Rabbit Holes](https://www.justsecurity.org/80395/united-nations-response-options-to-russias-aggression-opportunities-and-rabbit-holes/):

> It is not for any Secretary-General to decide what is a State and what isn’t, what continues a State and what does not. That is for the members of the club itself – UN Member States. Secretary-General Pérez de Cuéllar, who was ending his term in a few days, sent a note verbale to all Members and other UN organizations circulating the Yeltsin letter. And he waited for any formal reaction. There was none. Without any objections, questions, requests that anything be done such as convening a body or inscribing an item on an agenda, or the like, the Secretary-General would follow the request and change the nameplate from USSR to Russian Federation, change the alphabetical listing of members and replace the old flag with the new, including in any bodies that the USSR had been a member of such as the Security Council. Any member can change its name and flag anytime it wants. 
> As mentioned, I was a Principal Legal Officer in the Office of the Legal Counsel at that time and do not have any recollection of any legal opinion offered by that Office opining on the validity of the Russian claim, nor I suspect would there have been one along those lines. 

Thus there were no objections, but also no legal or formal decision about Yeltsin's letter and participation of representatives of the Russian Federation in the work of the UN. 

# Law 

## Is Russia a continuator or a successor to SU ?

A continuing state, also known as a continuator or historical heir is a state which despite change to its government, borders, or name retains the same legal personality and possesses all its existing rights and obligations. 

A successor state is a new international legal personality. A state succession can be characterized as either being universal or partial.

A universal state succession occurs when one state is completely extinguished and its sovereignty is replaced by that of one or more successor states. A partial state succession occurs when the state continues to exist after it has lost control of a part of its territory. 

In 1992 professor Yehuda Blum (former permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations) published an article [Russia Takes Over the Soviet Union's Seat at the United Nations](http://www.ejil.org/article.php?article=2045&issue=102)), in which he drew attention to the provisions of the Belovezh Accords, and expressed legal doubts about the validity of Russia's taking a seat on the Security Council. 

As we can see from above mentioned documents [international legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_legal_personality) ([Международная правосубъектность](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C)) of the USSR was terminated with the entry into force of the Belovezh Accords and the creation of Commonwealth of the Independent States. 

There are states - successors of the SU, but there are not, and can not be a continuing state, as SU international legal personality ceases to exist. 

### International Court of Justice preliminary decision in Ukraine v Russia (2022)

There is a case [Allegations of Genocide under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/182) at ICJ. 

See: 
[Application Instituting Proceedings filed in The Registry Of The Court On 26 February 2022 Dispute Relating To Allegations Of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/182/182-20220227-APP-01-00-EN.pdf)

On March 16, 2022 ICJ issued an [Order](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/182/182-20220316-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) in art. 27 of which was stated: 

> The Russian Federation is a party to the Genocide Convention as the State continuing
the legal personality of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 

However, this was a reference to a circumstance recognized by the parties to the dispute, without an analysis of the underlying problem.

Is it possible to change the ICJ established position? 

As was noted in [Croatia v. Serbia](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/118/118-20081118-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf), the Court departs from settled jurisprudence (jurisprudence constante) only if it is of the opinion that there are very particular reasons to do so. 
But, if such reasons would be provided it's possible. 

## If successors of the disappeared state can automatically continue its membership in UN? 

Definitely not. In every case, where the UN had issued formal decisions on these questions (for successors of British India, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia), the UN decided that it's not allowed under the UN Charter. 

Note the case of Pakistan in 1947. Then Pakistan turned to the UN with a letter similar to Yeltsin's, arguing that after the partition of British India  "India and Pakistan should become Members of the United Nations, automatically, with effect from 15 August" 
But as Pakistan was successor, and not a continuing state to British India, UN SC decided that Pakistan should go through the formal process of becoming a member of the organization.

The general rule adopted in Pakistan case was articulated by [the Sixth (Legal) Committee](https://www.un.org/en/ga/sixth/) of the General Assembly: 

> That when a new State is created, whatever may be the territory
and the populations which it comprises and whether or not they formed
part of a State Member of the United Nations, it cannot under the system of
the Charter claim the status of a Member of the United Nations unless it has
been formally admitted as such in conformity with the provisions of the
Charter. 

(see: [Michael P. Scharf Musical Chairs: The Dissolution of States and Membership in the United Nations // Cornell International Law Journal, Volume 28, Issue 1 Winter 1995](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1338&context=cilj))

So there is established law in this matter, and practice following this law in all cases. 
Thus representatives of RF have a place in the UN only because there was no formal discussion or decision on the RF case.  

## GA Resolution resolution on China as a legal precedent.

Our draft of the GA resolution follows the principles laid by [General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 (Restoration of the lawful rights of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758), which was also a decision about removing representatives of a certain government "from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations" 

Like it was with General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 this resolution should be considered as a question under Article 18 of the UN Charter ("the suspension of the rights and privileges of membership"), and thus would require a two-thirds supermajority for approval.

> Decisions of the General Assembly on important questions shall be made by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. These questions shall include: recommendations with respect to the maintenance of international peace and security, the election of the non-permanent members of the Security Council, the election of the members of the Economic and Social Council, the election of members of the Trusteeship Council in accordance with paragraph 1(c) of Article 86, the admission of new Members to the United Nations, the suspension of the rights and privileges of membership, the expulsion of Members, questions relating to the operation of the trusteeship system, and budgetary questions. 

(art. 18 [Charter of the United Nations](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations#Article_18)) 

# Possible objections for proposed GA resolution and grounds for their rejection.

## Estoppel or laches

### Is it possible to use estoppel to keep for Russian diplomats the right to represent the vanished USSR? 

This argument was expressed in [Larry D. Johnson United Nations Response Options to Russia’s Aggression: Opportunities and Rabbit Holes, March 1, 2022](https://www.justsecurity.org/80395/united-nations-response-options-to-russias-aggression-opportunities-and-rabbit-holes/): 

> It runs straight into what lawyers call a “laches” or “estoppel” problem or what lay people might call a “Speak now or forever hold your peace” problem. 
> 
> Members were notified that Russia claimed it was not a “successor State” but a “continuing State” with the support of the former republics of the USSR, and there was no opposition. 
> 
> On Christmas Eve 1991 the Soviet Permanent Representative Yuli Vorontsov came to the UN Secretariat with a box in his hand with a new flag of something called the “Russian Federation” and a letter to the Secretary-General signed by Boris Yeltsin, “President Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic” (RSFSR). It said “ the membership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the United Nations, including the Security Council and all other organs and organizations of the United Nations system, is being continued by the Russian Federation (RSFSR), with the support of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, by the Russian Federation.” Note it says “continued” not succession.
> 
> It is not for any Secretary-General to decide what is a State and what isn’t, what continues a State and what does not. That is for the members of the club itself – UN Member States. Secretary-General Pérez de Cuéllar, who was ending his term in a few days, sent a note verbale to all Members and other UN organizations circulating the Yeltsin letter. And he waited for any formal reaction. There was none. Without any objections, questions, requests that anything be done such as convening a body or inscribing an item on an agenda, or the like, the Secretary-General would follow the request and change the nameplate from USSR to Russian Federation, change the alphabetical listing of members and replace the old flag with the new, including in any bodies that the USSR had been a member of such as the Security Council. Any member can change its name and flag anytime it wants.
> 

So can we really rely on “laches” or “estoppel” rules to recognize that Russian diplomats in the UN still represent the USSR, despite the USSR ceasing its existence in 1991 ? 

Continuity, by definition, cannot be partial, unlike succession. 

Because continuity means that the same international legal personality continues to exist, although perhaps under a new name, with a new government, or with a change in national boundaries. 

One cannot be *partially* the same international legal personality.

One cannot be the same international legal personality just for membership in one international body, and be a different international legal personality in all other respects.

As we explained before, Belovezh Accords, Alma-Ata declaration, Treaty "On succession in relation to external state debt and assets of the USSR'', Declaration no. 142-N of the Soviet of the Republics of the USSR are based on the statement that the Soviet Union ceased to exist as an international legal personality. 

There is no way to admit that the USSR continues to exist only as a member of the UN, but has ceased to exist in all other respects. This contradicts the very idea of continuity. 

That is, if we raise at the General Assembly the issue of formally recognizing the right of Russian diplomats to continue to represent the vanished USSR on the basis of “laches” or “estoppel” rules, what decision should be made? 

It seems more than doubtful to us that the possibility of a formal decision of the General Assembly on the continuation of the representation of the vanished Soviet Union, if such a question is raised as requiring a formal decision. 

Unlike the China precedent, in which China as an international legal personality continued to exist but the General Assembly decided who should represent it, the Soviet Union as such ceased to exist. 

### Is it possible to recognize on the basis of estoppel that the Russian Federation is the sixth permanent member of the Security Council? 

As far as we know, no one has explicitly formulated the idea that RF can be formally recognized as a permanent member of UN SC using “laches” or “estoppel” rules, even if RF is not a continuator to the USSR. 

But this idea is very close to what Larry D. Johnson wrote and implicitly it sometimes appears in discussions, so we consider it useful to formulate and consider this idea explicitly.

It seems to us that such a position, if explicitly formulated, obviously goes far beyond what is possible on the basis of estoppel.

## Decision of the Council of Heads of States of the Commonwealth as ground for continuity. 

Another argument we can see in discussions, that [Decision of the Council of Heads of States of the Commonwealth Independent States](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1900103) is a reason to believe that the USSR did not cease to exist, but changed its name to the RSFSR (and this Decision should take precedence over the Belavezh Accords) 

This is the official position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. 
Spokesman of the MFA RF Maria Zakharova on her article [О правовых основаниях членства РФ в ООН (On the legal grounds for the membership of the Russian Federation in the UN)](https://actualcomment.ru/o-pravovykh-osnovaniyakh-chlenstva-rf-v-oon-i-bezgramotnosti-deyateley-ikh-osparivayushchikh-2202141353.html) wrote the following: 

> The state "USSR" did not ceased, but continued its international legal personality under the name "Russian Federation" 

In Russian: 

> государство под названием «СССР» не прекратило, а продолжило свою международную правосубъектность под названием «Российская Федерация» 

As the main reason for this Zakharova is referring to [Decision of the Council of Heads of States of the Commonwealth Independent States](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1900103).

Here we should remember that 'Commonwealth Independent States' itself was created by Belavezh Accords. CIS and its Council of Heads of States exists only as a result of the recognition of its members (including RF) that "the USSR, as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence". 

Thus that Decision of the Council of Heads of States of the Commonwealth Independent States in no way should be considered as anything more than political support for Russia's aspirations to gain a seat in the UN. This can in no way be interpreted as a decision that the *Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic* (Russian Federation) is the new name for the Soviet Union. 

# Conclusions 

The performance by Russian diplomats of the role of representatives of the disappeared Soviet Union in the UN, including in the Security Council, is legally unjustified. 

This problem has  particular political importance at the moment, since the Russian Federation, which has started a war of aggression, is defending itself against measures from the UN by illegally using the veto of the former Soviet Union.

An effective and legal way to eliminate this situation is the proposed draft of the UN General Assembly resolution stating that the Soviet Union no longer exists and no one can act on its behalf, and deciding to remove Russian representatives from the UN until RF will be formally accepted as a UN member.
