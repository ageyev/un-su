## The possibility for the UN to recognize that a certain UN member state has ceased to exist

Yes, we have a precedents of such a decision.

The claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue membership of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia membership in the United Nations (the same way as RF claimed to continue Soviet Union membership in UN) was rejected both by UN Security Council and UN General Assembly. 

We believe that if the issue of the Russian Federation is considered in a similar way by the Security Council, the Russian Federation, as a party to the dispute, is obliged to abstain from voting on this issue according to Art. 27 (3) UN Charter, as explained in [How to overcome the "veto power" in the UN Security Council](https://github.com/ageyev/un-su/blob/main/un_sc_voting.md)
